**No quantum physics background required!** We'll build up everything from scratch.

## 📖 Recommended Reading Order

1. **Linear path** (recommended for beginners):
   - Follow the order: 01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06

2. **Developer fast track**:
   - Skim: 01, 02
   - Focus: 04, 05, 06
   - Reference: 03 as needed

3. **Deep theoretical understanding**:
   - Thorough: All topics in order
   - Plus: External resources in each section

## 🎯 Learning Check

After completing this section, test your understanding:

1. Can you explain what a qubit is to a friend?
2. Can you describe superposition with an analogy?
3. Do you understand why measurement "collapses" quantum states?
4. Can you explain entanglement without using the word "quantum"?

If you can answer "yes" to these, you're ready for Part 2! 🎉
