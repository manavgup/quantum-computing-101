What will you measure for the second qubit?</p> Answer  You'll definitely measure 1 (100% probability). The entangled state ensures perfect correlation - both qubits always give the same result for |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9.  <p>Question 4: Can you use entanglement to send a message faster than light?</p> Answer  No! Individual measurement results are random. The correlation only becomes apparent when you compare results using classical communication (limited by speed of light). Relativity is preserved.  <p>Question 5: What's the difference between GHZ and W states?</p> Answer  - **GHZ:** (|000\u27e9 + |111\u27e9)/\u221a2 - Maximally entangled but fragile. Losing one qubit destroys all entanglement. - **W:** (|001\u27e9 + |010\u27e9 + |100\u27e9)/\u221a3 - More robust. Remaining qubits stay entangled if one is lost.
